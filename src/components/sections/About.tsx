      Today, I use my technical expertise to guide design and development teams
      as they create content for <Link link="https://bankofthewest.com" alias="bankofthewest.com"/> via multiple content
      management systems (CMS). I&apos;m a Web publisher with 10+ years of experience
      in the financial services industry with extensive experience in pre and
      post CMS migration. Comfortable working inside and outside an Agile
      framework to deliver results in a fast paced and an aggressive
      deadline-driven environment. Constantly stretching my technical writing
      skills by creating and maintaining help documentation, user/style guides,
      and onboarding materials used by design, development, and marketing teams
      to create and track content on the site.
